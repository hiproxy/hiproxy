## Contribution Content
Hiproxy is currently under development, you can choose the following content to contribute:

1. Features: add new features for hiproxy, such as new commands, directives and new pages.
2. Documentation: At present, hiproxy's documentation is not perfect, you can first understand the use of hiproxy, and then write the usage documentation or technical documentation.

## Steps for Contributing
1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/hiproxy/hiproxy/issues/new) for the bug you want to fix or the feature that you want to add.
2. Create your own [fork](https://github.com/hiproxy/hiproxy) on github, then checkout your fork.
3. Write your code in your local copy. It's good practice to create a branch based off the `master` branch for each new issue you work on, although not compulsory.
4. To run the test suite, first install the dependencies by running `npm install`, then run `npm test`.
5. If the tests pass, you can commit your changes to your fork and then create a pull request from there. Make sure to reference your issue from the pull request comments by including the issue number e.g. `#123`.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.

Thank you for contributing!
